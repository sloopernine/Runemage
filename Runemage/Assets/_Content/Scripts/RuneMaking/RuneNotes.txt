Notes for new changes to our RuneCloud system.

We might need to simplify it quite drastically.

Should we make it so that you can only create a single rune at a time? So that when you add to that, then everything becomes a part of that?
That becomes problematic when/if you draw something wrongly and don't know how to erase it...

You could have something going through the scene and finding all runes, and if they have fewer than a certain number of points then they are destroyed?
- This seems very simple, and it might not hurt...

Another later alternative, is to change the runecloud system. So... have everything become one rune? Hm... no... because what then with left-over lines?
